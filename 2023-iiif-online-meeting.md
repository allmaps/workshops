# Georeferencing the Internet Archive with Allmaps
Thursday, December 07, 2023

5:00 PM - 5:30 PM CET

Jules Schoonman & Bert Spaan

## Abstract
Following the exciting news about the collaboration between the IA and IIIF Consortium, this workshop explores the possibilities of annotating IA material using the Allmaps platform. We will locate relevant collections and resources in the IA, and open them in the Allmaps Editor using the available IIIF Manifest URIs. We'll look at the format of a Georeference Annotation and demonstrate its usages in the Allmaps Viewer and other tools. When working with open data that is not yet available elsewhere with IIIF, the IA can thus serve as a repository to launch geospatial research projects. This workshop will give you everything you need to get startedâ€“and the approach can be replicated for other IIIF content as well. When we run into problems, we'll create issues in the relevant repositories to help the development of both Allmaps and IA's IIIF implementation.
